# MY VIM CONFIG

Vim is a well know terminal text editor. It is not your standard GUI text editor. Vim doesn't not look nice out of the box, but with this repository, you can configure Vim in any way you like, with your imagination being the limit.

*Configuring Vim*

Copy and paste the `.vimrc` file to your home directory. We will then install Vundle to manage our plugins.

*Installing Vundle and Managing Plugins*

Clone the Vundle github repo.

``` 
git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
```

Once you install Vundle, use Vim and open `.vimrc`. Once you open that, run `:PluginUpdate` for the plugins to load.

All the commands to manipulate the plugins are in `.vimrc`.
